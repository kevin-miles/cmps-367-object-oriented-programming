CMPS-367-Objected-Oriented-Programming
======================================

C++ Projects from CMPS 367: Object oriented programming with C++.

These files are in folders numbered by the project number. 
The .cpp files inside each project folder contains header comments that give an overview on what the project does.
There is also a folder of unorganized notes I shared.

I do not plan on organizing this any time soon.

Students: I can't stop you, but try not to just copy. Learn the concept over practicing your copy and paste skills.
