CMPS-367-Objected-Oriented-Programming
======================================

What is this repo?
------------------
These are C++ Projects from the class CMPS 367: Object oriented programming with C++.

How is it organized?
--------------------
These files are in folders organized by the project number. 

Where do I find out what each project is?
-----------------------------------------
The .cpp files inside each project folder contains header comments that give an overview of the project.
The higher the number the more likely it will have more advanced programming features.

Are there any notes?
--------------------
There is also a folder of unorganized notes I shared.

Do you plan on editing/organizing these?
----------------------------------------
No.

Can I use your projects?
------------------------
I can't stop you, but please don't simply copy. I've seen too many students fail because of this.
Learn the concepts over using your copy and paste skills.
